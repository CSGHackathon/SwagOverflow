### Overview

Our application provides a centralized app for users to customize their media consumption experience. As services work now, users need to subscribe to many services like WatchESPN, Netflix, Hulu and others to watch shows that air on many channels, but for many reason's they may have missed it.

With this app, you can subscribe to shows and sports teams and stream all of the events live and even save them, similarly to a DVR.
